    <p align="justify">We&#8217;re thinking sustainability&#8230;</p>
	<p align="justify">
      Recent crew and campers have offered suggestions for making Cold River
          Camp more sustainable, including &#8220;use fewer paper products&#8221; and &#8220;compost
          food scraps.&#8221; <br><br>
      Many sustainable practices are already in place at Camp. Guest cabins
          use wood heat and no electricity; car-pooling to hikes is common; reusable
        cloth lunch bags are available; and guests and staff diligently recycle
        newspaper, cardboard, glass, metal, and aluminum cans. Energy efficient
        light bulbs are replacing incandescent, native plants are used in the
          perennial gardens, worn guest towels are reused as rags, and food scraps
          go daily
        to neighborhood pigs. Although we have vacuum cleaners and a drying room,
        it&#8217;s more common for the crew to use brooms to sweep floors and
        the clotheslines to dry laundry.<br>
        <br>
      Our current energy-saving and waste-reducing practices have qualified
        the Camp to be certified as an Environmental Partner by the New Hampshire
        Sustainable
        Lodging and Restaurant Program (<a href="http://www.nhslrp.org" target="NHSLRP">NHSLRP</a>). In 2008, we&#8217;re researching
        and evaluating other changes suggested by the NHSLRP. We have begun
        to compost coffee grounds (pigs don&#8217;t need caffeine), offer tissues
        and paper cups for campers by request only, and promote the use of bandannas
        as trail lunch napkins instead of paper napkins.<br>
        <br>
      Sometimes, as we consider these sustainability efforts, they seem to
        point to times past, when most things were simpler and had less impact.
        In some
        ways, earlier times at Camp can be a model for sustainability efforts
        today. But we recognize that there are some things that don&#8217;t deserve the
        moniker &#8220;back in the good ole days&#8221; &#8211; like cold showers.<br><br>
      To further advance these initiatives, the Camp has been awarded a small
        conservation grant by the AMC. This is funding an intern who will evaluate
        the carbon footprint of the Camp, energy use, and the use of other resources.
        A report and recommendations will be provided to the Camp&#8217;s governing
        Committee this fall. The report is now available as a <a href="/Pages/CRCResourceConsumption08.pdf" title="pdf file">pdf
        file</a> (may take
        a while to download).<br>
        <br>
      We think Cold River Camp is an ideal, low-impact &#8211; yet rich and rewarding &#8211; vacation
        experience. Campers &#8211; who often return year after year &#8211; choose
      this simpler, greener community.</font></p>
