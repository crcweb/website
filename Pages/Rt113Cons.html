  <p><strong><font color="#E20000" size="5">Route 113 through Evans Notch will
        be closed starting Friday, Nov. 14, for a bridge replacement.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><br>
    Maine Department of Transportation will be closing the Little Lary Brook
      Bridge on Route 113 in Batchelders Grant Township to replace the bridge.
      Little Larry Brook flows under Route 113 in Batchelders Grant just south
      of the Gilead town line. The bridge is located .3 miles south of the Gilead
      town line. Crews will be replacing a temporary bridge that was put in place
      after heavy rains washed out the existing bridge on July 11-12, 2007. The
      previous bridge had a span of 17 feet and was 18 feet wide. The new bridge
      will be 60 feet long and 22 feet wide. It will cost $550,000 to replace
      the bridge. The Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division is funding the repairs
      using emergency relief funds for federally owned roads. Route 113 will
      be closed to the public during the replacement. Route 113 is annually closed
      to winter traffic as well. Signs will be posted alerting motorists that
  the bridge will be closed to traffic. </p>
  <p align="justify">Crews will be working through the
        winter to replace the bridge. Snowmobilers, cross-country skiers and
    others who utilize the road when it is closed in the winter will still be
    able
        to do so. This
      section of ITS 80, part of Maine's Interstate Snowmobile Trail System,
    will still be open during the bridge replacement. Even though this section
    of
      road will be closed this winter, those who wish to access ITS 80 can do
    so from the Route 2 Rest Area in Gilead. </p>
  <p align="justify">Technical Construction of Turner,
      Maine
        will remove and replace the existing bridge. If the project proceeds
    as planned and there are no unexpected delays or problems, Maine Department
      of Transportation
          plans to reopen the
        bridge on April 1, 2009. Whether or not Route 113 opens at that time
    will
        depend upon the severity of the winter and how much snow remains at the
      beginning of April. The entire project is expected to be completed by May
      30, 2009. </p>
