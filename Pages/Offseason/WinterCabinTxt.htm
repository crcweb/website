  <p align="center"><strong>Cold River Camp Winter Cabin Use 2014-2015</strong></p>
  <p>During the summer season the building known as the &quot;Convent&quot; serves as quarters for the female camp crew members. The rest of the year, October through early May, it is available as the &quot;Winter Cabin&quot; rental. </p>
  <p>The cabin is insulated and has an efficient woodstove to provide heat and, if need be, a cooking surface. There is electricity in the cabin and a small kitchen area. There are six bunks in the bunkroom. The kitchen is equipped with a small refrigerator, a microwave, a coffee maker, a toaster and a hot water kettle. Plates, mugs, bowls and cookware are provided too.</p>
  <p>There is no running water so guests must bring their own water in addition to food, bedding, and towels. Wool blankets, pillows, and wood for the stove are all provided.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
    There is a composting toilet separate and just behind the cabin. &nbsp;Please bring an additional half-gallon of water for 'priming' the toilet.&nbsp; Instructions for how to do this are provided at the cabin.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
    The driveway gates are locked and a small area at the edge of Route113 at the northern driveway entrance is available for parking. The walk into the cabin is about one tenth mile over a mostly flat, cleared area. </p>
  <p>The current season rate is $80 per night. Payment in advance is requested. </p>
  <p>Please check the online reservation calendar for availability.</p>
  <p>Contact the registrar for more information and reservations. With the confirmation of a reservation, guests receive cabin instructions including directions for where to pick up the cabin key. </p>
  <p>Note: Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, all camp policies remain in effect during the off-season. In particular note that Cold River Camp is an AMC facility and falls under AMC's prohibition of bearing arms in AMC destinations, which reads as follows: All guests and visitors to AMC Destinations and other AMC facilities are asked to refrain from bearing arms (concealed or revealed) while within the facility or immediate environs for the comfort and safety of all guests. Special exceptions may be made solely at the discretion of the winter cabin registrar for hunters or unusual circumstances but only if the comfort and safety of other guests is assured.</p>
