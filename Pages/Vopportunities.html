    <p>
      Cold River Camp (CRC) is successful because of the efforts of its many
        volunteers. All camp activities are overseen by the Cold River Camp Committee,
        a group of volunteers who establish policies for the property, affairs,
        business and operation of the camp. Other volunteers help with
        a wide variety of camp projects and activities. Volunteers are the lifeblood
        of Cold River Camp!  </p>
    <p>New volunteers are always welcome. If you enjoyed your camp experience,
      would you be willing to share your talents to make CRC an even better place?
      You do not need a background in education, recreational management or environmental
    science, just a simple willingness to help.</p>
    <p>Volunteering for CRC can be a very rewarding experience. Ask anyone who
    does it!</p>

      <strong>How Can I Volunteer at CRC?</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Volunteering for Cold River
      Camp takes many forms, and your contributions of time and effort are welcomed
      in a variety of areas. If you would like more information about volunteering (To volunteer),  please contact the Volunteer Coordinator, <a href="mailto:awoods144@gmail.com">Antonia Woods</a>, or the <a href="mailto:amc.crcchair@gmail.com">Cold River Committee Chair</a> by
      e-mail or fill out a volunteer form while at
      Cold River Camp.</strong></p>
    <p align="center">
      <strong>Hike Leaders / Naturalists</strong></p>
    <p>Would you like to be a hike leader or naturalist? Hike leaders and naturalists
      receive training and undergo an &quot;apprenticeship&quot; <a href="/Pages/LeaderHandbooks/CRC LEADER PROGRAM 2014.pdf" title="Trip Leader Program">program</a> before
      they become leaders. They are encouraged to keep their skills sharp by
      participating in periodic &quot;refresher&quot; sessions. Special interests
      or a background in these areas are certainly helpful, but <em>people skills,
    common sense and a willingness to see to it that guests have a good time</em>    are much more important.</p>
    <p align="center">
      <strong>Maintenance / Facilities</strong> </p>
    <p>Keeping CRC's buildings and grounds operating properly requires continuing
      effort. Volunteers perform needed maintenance on <a href="CRC_Calendar.pdf" title="work weekends" target="_new">work weekends</a> in the
      spring and fall. Please join us for one or more of these <a href="../Pages/CRCworkWeekends.html" target="mainFrame" title="Work Weekends">CRC Work Weekends</a>. We get
    a lot done and have a lot of fun doing it!</p>
    <p>
      People with skills in plumbing, electrical work and carpentry are of course
        very welcome, but we also need people willing to paint, do landscaping,
      prune shrubs and trees, and do assorted simple jobs. </p>
      <p align="center"> <b> Extension Season Volunteer</b></p>
    <p> During the Extension Season, the dining facility and common areas including bathrooms and the lodge are maintained by volunteers.  They also assist the kitchen staff with some prep of meals and cleanup after meals.  There is ample time after morning chores and before evening ones to enjoy hiking or other activities.  Meals and lodging are provided.  You can volunteer for as little as a weekend, to as long as two weeks.
</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Individual and Committee Activity Involvement</strong> </p>
    <p>Individuals and committees administer various aspects of CRC life. CRC
      also hosts various events in the off-season,
      and volunteers make these possible. Some of the current volunteer opportunities
      are:
