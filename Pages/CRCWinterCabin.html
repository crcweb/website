            <p>During the summer season the building known as the &#8216;Convent&#8217; serves
            as quarters for the female crew members. In the 2008 - 2009 off-season &#8211; October
            1st through April 30th - it is available as a &#8216;Winter Cabin&#8217; rental. <br>
            <br>
            The cabin is winterized and has an efficient woodstove to provide
            heat and, if need be, a cooking surface. There is electricity in
            the cabin and a small kitchen area. There are six bunks in the bunkroom.
            The kitchen is equipped with a microwave oven, a small refrigerator,
            a two-burner
            hot plate, a coffee maker, a toaster and a hot water kettle.
           <br><br>
              There is no running water during the off-season and guests have
                  use of an outhouse located just to the north of the cabin.
                  Guests must bring
              their own water, food, bedding and linens. Blankets, pillows and
              wood for the stove are provided.
            <br><br>
              In the winter, the driveway gates are locked, so a key is provided.
              A small area at the edge of 113 is plowed at the northern driveway
              entrance. The driveway is not plowed beyond this point.
            <br><br>
              Current rental rate is $50/night for the cabin. Payment in advance
              is requested.            
            <br><br>
