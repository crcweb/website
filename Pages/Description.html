<p><strong>About Cold River Camp</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
  Cold River Camp (CRC) is a volunteer-managed, family-oriented, and full-service
facility of the Appalachian Mountain Club that welcomes AMC members and the general
public. CRC is located within the quiet and peaceful Evans Notch Valley on Rte.
113 in Chatham, NH. First built as a church camp, the original buildings were
purchased by the AMC in 1919 with additional cabins added later. Our current
campers still share the quiet and simple times of the camp&#8217;s beginnings.
Returning campers experience a welcome relief from their normal daily routine
as they turn in next to the granite millstone and begin their drive toward Conant
Lodge. Each week finds multi generational families and newcomers alike enjoying
the nearby trails and rivers. While many choose to hike within Evans Notch, others
venture further into the nearby Presidential and Mahoosuc ranges. For canoeists
and kayakers, the nearby Androscoggin and Saco Rivers offer daylong adventures
and the quiet rural roads invite joggers and bikers. Guests looking for other
activities will find many antique shops in nearby towns, as well as the outlet
malls and a golf course in neighboring No. Conway. While two delicious meals
are served daily in the Conant Lodge, each camper makes up their own lunch from
a bountiful lunch buffet in the morning.</p>
