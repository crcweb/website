<p align="justify" class="para">Each week during the summer season of Cold River Camp one of our trip leaders is a naturalist, familiar with the natural world in New England.&nbsp; While the naturalists will lead trips, they are also a source of information to the guests.&nbsp; They are very willing to share their knowledge of special places in the area including:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="para">
    <strong>Deer Hill Bog Wildlife Blind</strong> (USFS) (11 minute drive) best visited early morning or after dinner.&nbsp; Frogs, turtles, ducks, beaver, geese and, if lucky, moose can be seen.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="para"><strong>Lord Hill Mine</strong> (15-30 minute drive, 45-90 minute hike depending on trail used.&nbsp; Easy hike to a lunch spot with a great view and a mine for the young at heart.&nbsp; Safety goggles and hammers are available at CRC – check with the naturalist or manager.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="para">
    <strong>Leach Link</strong> - a level walk along Cold River.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn Left after crossing the CRC Dam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="para">
  In camp, take along your copy the <strong><em>Tea House Path – Conant Path <a href="../Pages/NatureTrail3.pdf" title="Nature Trail Loop">Nature Trail Loop</a></em></strong> guide included in your packet of CRC information and leisurely walk the trail along Cold River.&nbsp; For returning guests, please note that the Conant Path has been extended along the pasture (between markers 18 and 19) at a much gentler grade.&nbsp; The former steep trail over the edge of the Kane Terrace has been discontinued.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify" class="para">Along the way, a granite memorial bench on the Conant Path invites you to relax and listen to Cold River as it makes its way south.&nbsp; The screened Tea House, on the Tea House Path, invites you in to spend time and enjoy the sounds of nature.</p>
<p align="justify" class="para">
Other special activities include walking along Wild River; picking blueberries on Blueberry Mountain, Black Cap or Baldface Knob; enjoying a quick dip into Emerald or Rattlesnake Pools; discovering aquatic wildlife around Basin and Province Ponds; exploring mines; finding abandoned ruins from the CCC and logging periods of local history; and locating Esther Williams Pool.</p>
<p align="justify" class="para">
For our younger guests we have a <strong>Jr. Naturalist Program</strong> with booklets available designed for three age groups.&nbsp; Parents, and grandparents, are encouraged to work with their children in fulfilling the requirements, and upon completion, patches are awarded during Friday evening&rsquo;s Talent Show.&nbsp; The Naturalist who is available for advice and help oversees this program.&nbsp; We also have a coloring book for our very young guests.</p>
<p align="justify" class="para">
Field guides for wildflowers, trees, birds and stars are available in Conant Lodge for guests to borrow.&nbsp; Our most recent addition to the library is <strong><em>Naturally Curious</em></strong> by Mary Holland – a well-written photographic field guide and month-by-month journey through the natural world of New England.&nbsp; There are also books for children in the Jr. Naturalist Library in the Lodge, as well as equipment for water studies in the Recreation Hall&rsquo;s Naturalist Toolbox. </p>
