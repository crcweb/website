  <p>We are looking forward to our seventh season as summer managers at Cold River Camp! We've hired a fantastic and energetic crew and we can't wait for you to meet them! We have three returning crew members, Curren, Molly, and Ted. We have several new crew members, who may look familiar to you because all of them have either worked as fill-in crew or they have been coming to camp for years. They are Rebecca Fink, Juliette Fink, Rebecca Graham, Sarah Marsh, and Sylvia Cheever. We also have a new yet familiar face as the assistant manager this year, Gillian Graham. Gillian has been coming to camp for years and she is also a nurse. We are excited to welcome her aboard! Gillian's sister, Fiona will be back with us again this year, in a new position in the kitchen! We are so happy that  Zachary Porter will be heading up the kitchen staff again this year! Also joining the kitchen team is a new face, Bryton Maclellan. He comes to us straight from culinary school and we are excited to welcome him to the Cold River Camp family! But now itâ€™s time to settle in and get down to the business of summer. Relax and enjoy your stay. Welcome Back.
