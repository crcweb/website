  <p><strong>Welcome to Cold River Camp!</strong><br />
    We are looking forward to our fifth season as summer managers at Cold River. We feel incredibly fortunate to have our entire staff as well as half of the crew returning for another season with us.  Don&rsquo;t be surprised to see a lot of familiar faces!  We are very excited that Connie Morse is back as our assistant manager to help keep camp in top shape.  Zachary Porter, Stefan Gaschott, and Kyle Soeltz have returned for yet another summer of tasty meals. We have four returning crew members from last summer: Jonathan Burke, Chelsey Serrano, and the Fuchs brothers: Nathaniel and Walker. Joining them are four others that you will enjoy getting to know as well: Andrew, Leslie, Fiona, and Kira.  But now it&rsquo;s time to settle in and get down to the business of summer. Relax and enjoy your stay. Welcome Back.<strong></strong><br />
