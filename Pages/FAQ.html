<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><b>1.	What is a typical day at Cold River Camp (CRC)?</b><br />
    <br />
    Campers are awakened by the &#8220;<a href="/Pages/horn.html" target="_new" title="horn" aly="horn">horn</a>&#8221; at
    7 am with breakfast at 7:30 am. Between 7 and 7:30 am, many campers enjoy
    their first mug of coffee
    in
    the Conant Lodge and also put together their bag/trail lunch from the bountiful spread
    of ingredients available. Breakfast is served in a single seating so do not be late. During breakfast the hikes and naturalist programs
    for the day are announced and sign-up lists circulated. After breakfast those
    campers who have not made their lunch may do so. Campers who have signed
    up for a led activity gather on the front porch of Conant Lodge at the stated
    times. Those choosing to do other activities are on their own until dinner. <b>Remember
    to sign out on the &quot;wanderer's list&quot; if you leave camp on your
    own.</b> Visit our <a href="/Pages/campPhotos.html" title="camp photos" target="_new" alt="camp photos">camp photos</a> to view the  activities usually enjoyed in and near camp. <br />
    <br />
    During the day hot and cold drinks are available in Conant Lodge for those staying
    in camp and for returning hikers in the afternoon. For those campers not hiking,
    other activities include antiquing in the nearby towns, biking or running the
    nearby quiet roads, painting, wildlife viewing in a nearby blind maintained
  	by the WMNF, and driving to No. Conway for golf, shopping and other activities.</p>  
  	<p align="justify">A self-guiding <a href="/Pages/NatureTrail3.pdf" target="mainFrame" title="Nature Trail">nature trail</a> is located within Cold River Camp property.
    It combines the Tea House Path, which leads along the edge of the ravine to the Tea House
    and continues alongside Cold River to the Dam, and the Conant Path,
    which wanders along Cold River from near the Dam then makes its way back to Cold
    River Camp behind Cox cabin. The trail guide is available in the Conant Lodge and
    in your guest packet. <br />
    <br />
    A favorite destination after returning from a hike is the Cold River Dam.
    In the afternoon many campers can be found sunbathing on the ledges, shooting
    the chutes, swimming in the pool above the Dam, or examining with a hand
    lens
    the watery inhabitants of small pools within the ledges.<br />
    <br />
    Dinner is served  in a single setting at 6 pm. During dinner, reports are given for the day&#8217;s
    organized trips and the after dinner evening program is announced. This program could be a sing along, poetry reading, lawn games, square dance or a program such as trip photos
  	  offered
  	  by a camper. Each Friday evening features a Talent Night and campers are encouraged
  	  to participate with music, dance, poetry, skits. or their unique talents and bring their musical instruments to camp.<br />
	  </p>
<p><b>2.	What do I need to bring?</b></p>
    <u>For Around camp:</u><br />
    <br />
    One flashlight or headlamp per person with extra batteries,<br />
    Sleeping bag, although linens and blankets are provided, a sleeping bag will
    provide extra lightweight warmth on those cool New Hampshire nights,<br />
    Insect repellent, stick or lotion,<br />
    Comfortable casual clothes,<br />
    Bathing suit and beach towel,<br />
    Water and footwear,<br />
    Things to share and do (poetry, books, crafts, musical instruments for Talent
    Night),<br />
    Battery lantern (optional) iif you choose not to use kerosene lamp in cabin. Extra battery lanterns are  available for use at CRC.<br />
    <br />
    <u>For the Elements:</u><br />
    <br />
    Sun screen and lip cream (30 spf),<br />
    Sunglasses and sun hat,<br />
    Wool or fleece sweater, hat and gloves,<br />
    Windbreaker,<br />
    Rain gear for body, head and feet.<br />
    <br />
    <u>For Hiking:</u><br />
    <br />
    Sturdy, well broken in hiking boots and extra socks,<br />
    Daypack,<br />
    Reusable lunch bag (you can purchase one at CRC),<br />
    Hydration system or water bottles (quart or liter size),<br />
    Shirts and pants for all temperatures,<br />
    Emergency whistle,<br />
    Guidebooks and maps,<br />
    Camera (make sure the battery is charged),<br />
    Personal first aid kit (bandages, ace bandage, moleskin, bee sting kit, antibiotic
    ointment).
    
    <p align="justify"><b>3.	How strenuous are the hikes?</b><br />
    <br />
    Each day, led hikes are offered by AMC certified leaders.  The hikes vary
    in length and difficulty and can accommodate the abilities of most hikers.
    The hike leaders are knowledgeable about the trails in the nearby area and
    can suggest trips for those wishing to hike on their own. For the led hikes,
    car-pooling to the trailhead is encouraged.<br />
    <br />
    In addition, during most weeks a naturalist hike leader will lead hikes focusing
    on the natural world around CRC.<br />
    <br />
    During each week, a guided canoe/kayak trip is offered on either the nearby
    Androscoggin or Saco Rivers, interest, weather and river conditions permitting. The canoes/kayaks are rented from a local outfitter
    and there is an additional charge for this event. A guided hike will also be 
    offered. <br /></p>
      
    <p align="justify">
    <b>4.	Are young children welcomed at Camp?</b><br />
    <br />
            Yes, absolutely.  When we think of Cold River as being a family-oriented camp, we mean the whole family.  There is a long standing tradition of multi-generational families being comfortable at CRC.  With great variety in terrain –  a blueberry playing field visible from the porch, a grass lawn for playing soccer and other games, a shallow swimming river all dammed  up, a lovely nature trail in camp, camp roads for beginning bike practice, swings and a sandbox as well as the  children's  corner in the Lodge that supplies books, puzzles, and traditional board and card games to play at the tables after dinner –  CRC is a great chance to get reacquainted with grandchildren and grandparents who might not live next door.  Or, maybe siblings and their families all apply the same week to have a central and active reunion time with the support of delicious meals in common and the comfort of cabins.  CRC provides an amazing opportunity to be together in the gorgeous White Mountains and to enjoy a quieter pace with time to reconnect as a family and with the natural world.</p>
        
    <p align="justify">CRC provides a special Junior Naturalist Program for children up to the age of twelve to
      discover more about the environment around camp. Junior naturalist badges are awarded during the much anticipated all-camp, all-age  Talent  Night. Camp trip leaders  provide family-oriented hikes to places like the nearby mines or ponds, which are great places to work on Junior Naturalist Program badges. 
            
    <p align="justify">In the spirit of maintaining our positive community camp experience for all and for safety, children are required to be supervised by an adult at all times, including mealtimes and camp led outings like those mentioned above. Parents are, of course, responsible for their children's health, safety, and happiness – that part is just like at home.    
  
      
<p align="justify">Note that with the exception of two cabins (Tower and Barracks), electricity and toilet facilities are not available in the cabins, but in several separate bath/shower/toilet facilities. For additional information and to discuss what weeks and cabins would best fit your family of any size and any age range, feel free to contact the Camp Registrar.    </p>
    
    <p align="justify">
      <b>5.	What happens on rainy days?</b><br />
    <br />
    Rainy days offer a quiet, slower pace from the active sunny day activities.
    While led hikes will be offered, guests can also enjoy joining others in
    Conant Lodge to work on a large jig-saw puzzle, curl up with a good book
    in the woodstove
    warmed library, catch up on sleep, go antiquing in the nearby towns, or drive
    over to the No. Conway area for shopping and other activities. Most likely
    there will be a welcoming fire in Conant Lodge&#8217;s fireplace. A table
    in the Conant Lodge will provide hot and cold drinks during the day for campers
    remaining in camp.
  </p>
    
    <p align="justify">
    <b>6.	Describe the shower and bathroom facilities</b><br />
    <br />
    CRC has three central bath and shower facilities conveniently located
    within camp. The newest, for women, offers four showers with private changing
    room area, four toilets and a tub in a separate room. 
    This women’s  facility also provides a separate full (toilet, sink, shower) handicap access bathroom at the south end of the building. In addition, there is a separate men’s shower facility offering three showers and toilets, as well as a tub. The third facility is located across the camp from the previous two and offers separate, private divisions for men and women each containing two showers with private changing room area and three toilets. In addition, there is a half bathroom (toilet and sink) at Conant Lodge with outside access near the kitchen shed area.
      </p>
    
    <p align="justify">

    <b>7.	Describe the cabins</b><br />
    <br />
    There are 26 cabins that can accommodate one to six people depending on the <a href="/Pages/CRCcabins.html" title="cabin">cabin</a>.
    Trees that provide privacy and a sense of being within the natural environment
    surround each
    cabin. Half of the cabins are family cabins located along the
    south side of
    camp and extending down towards the dam, see <a href="/Pages/CRCmapRev.html" title="map">map</a>.
    These cabins are located on a flat area and are designed to accommodate families
    of up to six people.
    The other cabins are located along the edge of a ravine with views toward
    the mountains. While one ravine cabin will accommodate only one person, the
    other ravine cabins will
    accommodate two. <br />
    <br />
    In addition, the Barracks and the Tower also offer lodging for up to six
    people. Each has a toilet, sink and electricity. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> 
      Each cabin contains a bed, mattress, pillow, blankets, linens and a set of
      towels for each person. In addition, each cabin has a closet, bureau or cubbies, chairs,
      bedside
      table, kerosene lamp, waste basket, fire
      extinguisher, smoke detector, and most cabins have a fireplace or wood stove with wood and matches.(<a href="cabintable.html" title="see cabin list" target="_new">see cabin list</a>). The ravine cabins
      also have decks. A towel change is made part way through each week.<br /><br />
      For campers who bring a cooler for keeping drinks or other items cool, the camp has an ice dispenser for guest use.
    </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> 
    Cold River Camp will try to accommodate requests for cabins with electricity for guests with health-related needs. However, only a few of the cabins have an outlet and the ability to accommodate such requests cannot be guaranteed. Guests should bring their own battery-operated medical devices.
    <p>
        
    <p align="justify"><b>8.	Use of cell phones, laptop computers or other electronic devices?</b></p>
    
    <p align="justify"><b>Cell phone coverage is not available in camp</b>. Coverage is available within a few miles
    of camp along the state highway.  A phone 
    is available in camp for guests that requires the use of a phone card.</p>
    
    <p align="justify">
        The Cold River Camp experience centers on enjoyment of nature
and guest interactions, away from the routine of everyday life.
Accordingly, our personal electronic devices policy is: 
        <ul>
            <li>Device use in the lodge, the lodge porch, and library is limited to reading.</li>
            <li>Any form of device communication (voice/text/email, etc., incoming or outgoing) should be done discretely, away from other guests, and away from the lodge, lodge porch and library.</li>
            <li>Device use for personal entertainment (e.g., watching videos or playing video games) is limited to the guest cabins, and at noise levels unobtrusive to guest passers-by.</li>
            <li>Cords and device charging are to be kept within the confines of the charging station area in the
Rec Hall.</li>
            <li>Recognizing the occasional need of some guests to communicate with the outside world or to do personal work, Wi-Fi
access is available solely for those purposes, as a courtesy, in the area outside the camp office and in the Rec Hall. The Rec Hall is available for quietly doing personal work, shared with other uses, between the hours of 7:30 AM and 9:30 PM and outside of scheduled activities there. The camp office itself is off-limits.</li>
        </ul>

    <p align="justify">
    <b>9.	What is the camp policy regarding alcohol?<br />
    </b><br />
    While alcohol is allowed in camp, it must be consumed only in the privacy
    of your cabin.<br />
    <br />
    
    <b>10.	What is the camp policy regarding firearms?<br />
    </b><br />
    Cold River Camp is an AMC facility and falls under AMC's prohibition of bearing arms in AMC destinations, which reads as follows:
 
    All guests and visitors to AMC Destinations and other AMC facilities are asked to refrain from bearing arms (concealed or revealed) while within the facility or immediate environs for the comfort and safety of all guests.  Special exceptions may be made solely at the discretion of the manager/s for hunters or unusual circumstances but only if the comfort and safety of other guests is assured.<br />
	<br />
    
    <b>11.	What is the camp policy regarding pets, therapeutic pets, and service animals?<br/>
    </b><br />
    Service animals are gladly welcomed at Cold River Camp. The AMC's lodging policy at this time does not accomodate any other kind of pet besides services animals - therapeutic or otherwise. As such, campers and visitors are not allowed to bring non service animal pets to Cold River Camp. <br />

	<br />
      
    <b>12.	Can CRC accommodate my special diet?</b><br />
    <br />
    CRC takes pride in serving appetizing, hearty and healthful family-style
meals, and strives to provide a variety of options to appeal to
a diversity of guests’ tastes. Due to the nature of our finite kitchen
resources, we provide a pre-planned menu for each meal. We cannot
prepare a specialty meal for each individual guest. <br /><br />
    <u>Typical menus </u><br />
    
    <u>Breakfast</u> - hot and cold cereal, fruit, an egg dish or pancakes/French toast, often accompanied by a breakfast meat.<br />
    <u>Lunch</u> - Variety galore on the trail lunch table, including assorted breads, deli meats, cheeses, PB & J, veggies, fruit and snack items.<br />
    <u>Dinner</u> - salad, main entrée, at least one vegetable, bread, and dessert. <br /><br />
     
    Soy milk is available at all meals.  <br /> <br /> 
    
    <u>With advanced guest notification</u> we can often meet vegetarian,
lactose-free (camp does not provide Lactaid milk; guests are welcome
to bring their own to be stored for them), and gluten-free diets
(guests with gluten free diets are asked to bring gluten free pasta,
bread, and muffin mix for the camp chef to prepare), or can accommodate
some food allergies. <u>Please call the camp managers prior to
your week in order to discuss accommodating your dietary needs.</u>
Please note: ice is available for guest that choose to bring coolers to
store their preferred snacks and beverages. .
    <br /><br />
    
    <b>13.	Is there anything for sale at CRC? </b><br />

    CRC patches, CRC T-shirts, CRC mugs, postcards, stamps, notecards and the Cold River Camp AMC Hiking Guide 7.1 2012.<br />

    Yes. Many people bring along something to play at sing-alongs, at pick up
    jam sessions, or at the traditional Friday night talent show. All instruments
