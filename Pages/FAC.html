    <strong>3.	What is a typical day at Cold River Camp (CRC)?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Campers are awakened by the &#8220;<a href="/Pages/horn.html" title="horn">horn</a>&#8221; at
    7 am with breakfast at 7:30 am. Between 7 and 7:30 am, many campers enjoy
    their first mug of coffee
    in
    the Conant Lodge and also put together their lunch from the bountiful spread
    of ingredients available. During breakfast the hikes and naturalist programs
    for the day are announced and sign-up lists provided. After breakfast those
    campers who have not made their lunch may do so. Campers who have signed
    up for a led activity gather on the front porch of Conant Lodge at the stated
    time. Those choosing to do other activities are on their own until dinner. <strong>Remember
    to sign out on the &quot;wanderer's list&quot; if you leave camp on your
    own.<br>
    </strong><br>
    During the day cold drinks are available in Conant Lodge for those staying
    in camp and for returning hikers in the afternoon. For those campers not hiking,
    other activities include antiquing in the nearby towns, biking or running the
    nearby quiet roads, painting, wildlife viewing in a nearby blind maintained
  by the WMNF, and driving to No. Conway for golf, shopping and other activities.  
  <p>Two self-guiding nature trails are located within Cold River Camp property.
    One, the Tea House Path, leads along the edge of the ravine to the Tea House
    and continues alongside Cold River to the Dam. The other, the Conant Path,
    wanders along Cold River from near the Dam and makes its way back to Cold
    River Camp behind Cox cabin. Trail maps are available in Conant Lodge and
    in your guest packet. Both trails can be combined into one hike of about
    one mile in length.<br>
    <br>
    A favorite destination after returning from a hike is the Cold River Dam.
    In the afternoon many campers can be found sunbathing on the ledges, shooting
    the chutes, swimming in the pool above the Dam, or examining with a hand
    lens
    the watery inhabitants of small pools within the ledges.<br>
    <br>
    Dinner is served at 6 pm, during which time reports are given for the day&#8217;s
    organized trips. At 7:30 pm each evening there is a planned activity held
    in the Recreation Hall. The activity could be a square dance or a program
    offered
    by a camper. Each Friday evening features Talent Night and campers are encouraged
    to participate and to bring musical instruments with them to camp.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>4.	How strenuous are the hikes?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Each day led hikes are offered by AMC certified leaders.  The hikes vary
    in length and difficulty and can accommodate the abilities of most hikers.
    The hike leaders are knowledgeable with the trails in the nearby area and
    can suggest trips for those wishing to hike on their own. For the led hikes,
    car-pooling to the trailhead is encouraged.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, during each week naturalist hike leaders will lead hikes focusing
    on the natural world around CRC.<br>
    <br>
    During each week a guided canoe/kayak trip is offered on either the nearby
    Androscoggin or Saco Rivers. The canoes/kayaks are rented from a local outfitter
    and there is an additional charge for this event. There will be guided hikes
  offered on this day as well. <br>
  <br>
    <strong>5.	Are young children welcomed at Camp?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Yes. Keep in mind, however, that with the exception of two cabins, electricity
    and toilet facilities are not available in the cabins. CRC does have a sand
    box and swing set, as well as a lawn area for children to play on. Bicycles
    are also available to ride while at camp. There is a Children&#8217;s Corner
    in Conant Lodge that is supplied with the appropriate books, games and puzzles.
    Each family is solely responsible for the supervision of their children.<br>
    <br>
    CRC offers the Junior Naturalist Program for children up to the age of twelve
    to discover more about the natural world around camp. Upon completion of
    their assigned projects they are awarded their Junior Naturalist badges during
    Talent
    Night.<br>
    <br>
    Children are included in many of the evening programs and are encouraged
    to participate in the Talent Night on Friday evening.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>6.	What happens on rainy days?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Rainy days offer a quiet, slower pace from the active sunny day activities.
    While led hikes will be offered, guests can also enjoy joining others in
    Conant Lodge to work on a large jig-saw puzzle, curl up with a good book
    in the woodstove
    warmed library, catch up on sleep, go antiquing in the nearby towns, or drive
    over to the No. Conway area for shopping and other activities. Most likely
    there will be a welcoming fire in Conant Lodge&#8217;s fireplace. A table
    in the Conant Lodge will provide hot and cold drinks during the day for campers
    remaining in camp.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>7.	Describe the shower and bathroom facilities</strong><br>
    <br>
    The camp has three central bath and shower facilities conveniently located
    within camp. The newest, for women, offers four showers with private changing
    room area, four toilets and a tub in a separate room. In addition, there
    is a separate men&#8217;s shower offering three showers and toilets, as well
    as a tub. The third facility is located across the camp from the previous
    two
    and offers showers and toilets, separately, for men and women.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>8.	Describe the cabins</strong><br>
    <br>
    There are 26 cabins that can accommodate one to six people depending on the <a href="/Pages/CRCcabins.html" title="cabin">cabin</a>.
    Trees that provide privacy and a sense of being within the natural environment
    surround each
    cabin. Half of the cabins are family cabins located along the
    south side of
    camp and extending down towards the dam, see <a href="/Pages/CRCmapRev.html" title="map">map</a>.
    These cabins are located on a flat area and are designed to accommodate families
    of up to six people.
    The other cabins are located along the edge of a ravine with views toward
    the mountains. While one ravine cabin will accommodate only one person, the
    other ravine cabins will
    accommodate two. <br>
    <br>
    In addition, the Barracks and the Tower also offer lodging for up to six
    people. Each has inside plumbing and electricity.<br>
    <br>
    Each cabin contains bed, mattress, pillow, blankets, linens and a set of
    towels for each person. In addition, each cabin has a closet, bureau, chair,
    bedside
    table, pitcher with fresh water, bowl, kerosene lamp, waste basket, fire
    extinguisher, smoke detector, fireplace, wood and matches. The ravine cabins
    also have decks. A towel change is made part way through each week.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>9.	What is the camp policy regarding alcohol?<br>
    </strong><br>
    While alcohol is allowed in camp, it must be consumed only in the privacy
    of your cabin.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>10.	What is the camp policy regarding pets?<br>
    </strong><br>
    Campers and visitors are not allowed to bring pets to Cold River Camp. <br>
<br>
    <strong>11.	Can CRC accommodate my special diet?</strong><br>
    <br>
    CRC has always prided itself in trying to serve good tasting and healthful
    family-style meals. While we strive to provide a variety of options to respond
    to as many tastes as possible, we are limited to a set menu for each meal.
    If you do have specific dietary needs, such as food allergies or a medically
    restricted diet, please let us know about them when you arrive. We will try
    to accommodate you as best we can. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>12.	Is there anything for sale at CRC?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Reusable lunch bags, AMC trail guidebooks, CTA trail maps, CRC bandanas,
    CRC patches, CRC T-shirts, CRC mugs, postcards, stationary and stamps.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>13.	Can I bring a musical instrument?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Yes. Many people bring along something to play at sing-alongs, at pick up
    jam sessions, or at the traditional Friday night talent show. All instruments
    are
    welcome. There is a tuned piano in the Recreation Hall.<br>
    <br>
