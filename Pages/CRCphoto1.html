               The lunch table offers many varieties of bread, along with sliced meats, cheeses, tuna and egg salad, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, celery and carrot sticks, apples, oranges, granola bars, cheese cubes, home made fruit cake and cookies – and peanut butter and jelly. Lunches can be made either before or after breakfast.<br />
                <br /> 
A second horn, at 7:30 AM, proclaims breakfast is being served.  Announcements of the day’s hikes are made during breakfast,  and sign up sheets are passed around.  Then it’s off to get organized for the activities of the day.  For many guests, that means to prepare for a hike – either CRC led or on their own.     </p>

             Mid afternoon finds hot showers and cold lemonade waiting for guests.  Once cleaned and refreshed, one can enjoy quiet moments or other in-camp <a href="/Pages/CRCphoto4.html" target="mainFrame" title="CRCphoto4">activities</a> while waiting for dinner.:  Relaxing on the lodge porch reading, talking to friends, or watching hummingirds is one way to wind down after a busy day.  Another  is to swim at the dam, walk our self-guiding <a href="/Pages/NatureTrail3.pdf" target="mainFrame" title="Nature Trail">Nature Trail</a> or enjoy a game of volleyball on our grass court. Youngsters often play on the lawn in front of the lodge, ride bicycles on our driveways, play quiet games in our lodge, play music or ping-pong in our rec hall or work with their families on Junior Naturalist projects.<br />
             <br />
             Guests come together on the lodge porch a few minutes before 6 PM to await the horn announcing dinner.
