<p class=MsoNormal><b>Status Update (4/26/2019)</b></p>

<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Hello AMC Cold River Camp
Community,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Since our last update in
December, the Camp has been under a deep fluffy blanket of deep white snow for
most of the winter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During this time,
the Cold River Camp Lodge/Dining/Kitchen Planning Committee (Lodge Planning
Committee or LPC) has been busy on an almost weekly basis.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our Thursday evening conference calls now
seem like a normal part of our schedule as we have actively discussed many
alternatives and evaluated potential plans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>With the warmer weather on the horizon, we thought it appropriate to now
sit down and provide the Camp Community with a <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>broad update on some of the main points</b> of our discussions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>-The LPC wants
to make sure that the Camp continues to prosper over the next century. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>-<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b>The Lodge dining and kitchen are in
need of attention to correct deficiencies<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>-There have been
substantial alterations to Camp over the past century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>-Over the past
four months the LPC has made a significant amount of progress in our planning
effort</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>- The LPC discussed
and evaluated the impact of minimum, intermediate, and expanded (or more
extensive) levels of modification/renovation changes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>-An initial
study to look at the potential use of solar energy has begun</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>- The LPC is now
at the point in the process where it would be helpful to get additional professional
input on potential designs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>-<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b>There are key factors that should be
part of any future plans</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>- The LPC
recently engaged a different architectural firm to develop a conceptual design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>- The LPC plans
to review the outcome of this work during the next two months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>- The LPC
encourages your feedback!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Any proposal
from LPC will be reviewed with the CRC community for input before any final
decisions are made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>First we want to provide you with
our most recent collective perspective on the main reasons why we have embarked
on this planning process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Cold River Camp has operated
successfully for one hundred years.<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to make sure that the Camp continues
to prosper over the next century.</b><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This will require that we maintain an attractive and welcoming environment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Making sure that our facilities are in good
working order and provide the guests with highly functional common facilities,
such as dining and social, will be important to our ability to continue to
attract and keep future guests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Lodge-related Camp facilities are in need of attention:</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>The <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>dining porch</b> roof is separating from
the main roof. This part of the lodge sits on cinder blocks which are now
settling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The decay of this entire
structure/addition to the lodge is accelerating and must be addressed
soon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The current seating is perceived by many as
crowded, especially in the dining porch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span></b>In addition, it is difficult to see and hear the speakers during
meal announcements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need to carefully
consider ways of improving the dining area while maintaining the current
intimate and unique dining experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>We want to
maintain an inclusive facility, which is consistent with AMC’s goals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The
camp is only ADA compliant in <u>highly limited way</u>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is particularly evident in the Lodge,
one of the main common buildings at Camp, where there are <u>major deficiencies</u>.</b><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, it is extremely difficult to
accommodate more than one person with a wheel chair for a meal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, there is no ADA compliant
bathroom in or near the Lodge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>The <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>kitchen is only compliant with building
codes as required for <u>the last time it was renovated, which is many decades
ago</u>. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></b>A new renovation will
allow us to bring the kitchen up to current code, improve the efficiency of its
operation, and make it a safer and better working environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The social area of the Lodge seems small
relative to the number of guests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></b>The
social area becomes crowded at times, especially just before meals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are only about a dozen or so seats
available for the roughly 70 guests when the Camp is full.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Addressing these concerns as a whole</b>,
before they become an issue <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>will allow a
comprehensive, holistic and well thought out solution</b>, rather than the
implementation of undesirable less optimal and/or piecemeal emergency measures hastily
put in place to keep the camp operating. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Although you may think the
mystique of the Camp is that the Camp never changes, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>there have been substantial alterations over the past century.</b><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The present Camp Committee and those of the
past worked hard to make sure that modifications of the facilities were done in
a respectful way so as to fit in well and maintain the notion that “things stay
the same at Cold River Camp”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
example, do you know that there are three cabins that were built from the
ground up during the past 10-15 years?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Two were replacements for existing cabins, and one is completely new
(Notchview, Alice, and Caribou).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Although most cabins have a fireplace with a stone chimney, each of these
three “new cabins” has a small wood stove and no stone chimney.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Another example of dramatic <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>change at Camp can be viewed through the
Lodge</b>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>Its three functional areas include social, dining, and food preparation
(kitchen).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Each of these areas has
changed dramatically over the past 100 years.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The
original building did not have the dining porch or the current kitchen. The
kitchen was behind the fireplace and the social and dining areas were in front
of the fireplace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All 37 guests for the
first summer ate there (we now have over 550 during the summer).</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Over
time, a new building was added on to the Lodge to create a new kitchen and the
area behind the fireplace became a dining area.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Eventually
a dining porch that could hold four tables was added.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A major controversy occurred at Camp when a
proposal was made to increase the dining porch area so that it could hold five
tables in the 1980s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The Camp is doing
well today because of these modifications that blend in so well with our view
of Cold River Camp. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>Enough perspective.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What have we
been working on?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Over the past four months we have made significant progress in our
planning</b>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We continued to
systematically review and evaluate various designs, including those submitted
through Community feedback.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We compared
these designs with the current Lodge in four areas:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>functional/operational;
aesthetics/historical; climatic performance/comfort; and sustainability.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Although the group did not accept any of
these designs, we did gain a great deal of knowledge by assessing the pluses
and minuses of each proposal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We will
use this information as we move forward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>A more recent proposal referred to as the “East Expansion” did receive
some positive responses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This potential
plan suggests moving all dining into the existing old kitchen space, which is
probably at least 70-80 years old, and building a new kitchen to the north and
east.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At this point this concept has not
been fully vetted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>We also evaluated on a broad-brush basis the impact of a minimum,
intermediate, and expanded (or more extensive) potential Lodge changes.</b><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Status Update (12/19/2018)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hello Cold River Camp Community!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the beginning of what will become more regular updates on the Lodge Planning Project. Each week last summer the Lodge/Dining/Kitchen Planning Committee (the Lodge Planning Committee) presented a Lodge planning status update as a way of actively communicating with the CRC Community about the Lodge Planning project.  We received significant Community feedback as a result of those meetings, as well as from members who directly provided comments via mail, email or online.  We have carefully reviewed and discussed all of that feedback over the past few months and incorporated it into our planning process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lodge/Dining/Kitchen Planning Committee (the Lodge Planning Committee) has been extremely active since last summer, but remains in the planning phase.  No specific proposal has been reviewed and gained wide acceptance even within the Committee, whether it be one of the six concepts presented in the summer or anything else.  The Committee has met regularly in weekly conference calls since September.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since last summer, the Committee has done the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a. revised and updated a proposed priority of requirements to help guide the Committee’s design choices;</p>
 
<p class=MsoNormal>b. done a quantitative assessment of the six design concepts from the summer as a basis for further discussion of their relative strengths and weaknesses as a mutual learning exercise;</p>
 
<p class=MsoNormal>c. systematically reviewed and evaluated the current Lodge dining, social, and kitchen areas in terms of the existing design by focusing on four areas:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span>aesthetics/historical;</p>

Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Sustainability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And as part of that review captured an extensive amount of detail about the uses and measurements and characteristics of the current Lodge main areas—dining kitchen, social, porch, bathroom, and have become more educated on some of the building and health code implications of potential changes, and become more aware of possible ripple effects that involve, e.g., Lodge foundation, septic system or electrical service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The purpose of this review was to aid in the future development and evaluation of designs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have systematically reviewed all of the guest feedback since the beginning of this project to make sure we fully understand the suggestions and concerns received so far. We have incorporated this feedback, including specific alternate design concept suggestions, into our discussions and evaluations.  We plan to continue to solicit and evaluate future feedback as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since May we have expanded the Committee to include Jan Irvin, who is a professional architect with significant experience in the rehabilitation of  historic structures. Jan is a long-time Camp guest, and is a volunteer member of the Committee. In addition, Laurie Barr, former CRC Manager, is now a permanent member of the Committee, and has participated in numerous meetings, allowing the valuable perspective she brings to be more fully present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We plan to follow-up this communication with periodic updates.  The purpose of these ongoing updates is to provide a high level overview of what the Committee has considered and evaluated so that the you have a better understanding of how the planning process is progressing.  We encourage you to provide feedback and ideas by either going directly to the Camp’s website (by clicking “About CRC” then “Lodge Planning Project” then look for the “Community Lodge feedback form near the bottom of the page) or by using this link

<p class=MsoNormal>We look forward to hearing more from you, and to providing you with future updates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Status Update (5/4/2018)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two active committees and an architect:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>An overall Lodge / Dining Area Committee (Emma Crane, Evan Doucett, Nancy Hartle, Bobby Kaufman, Amy Grover, Frank Mastro, Gary Munson, Mark Winkler) which is to looking at overall Lodge needs including Dining; (until mid-February this was two separate committees, overall Lodge, and Dining Room, which agreed to merge given overlap and determining that the bulk of the attention will be on the dining area and related aspects).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A Kitchen Committee (Garry Crane, John Dean, Frank Mastro, Cheryl Poirier, Gail Roberts, Jim Weston) which is to propose a recommendation for a major kitchen renovation.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Architect Anne Whitney of Portsmouth NH, who has extensive experience in working on historic structures and lives and volunteers in a very history preservation-minded town and came highly recommended by one of our committee members based on personal experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two committees and the architect are working closely together.  Additionally, we have greatly benefitted from the participation of past camp manager and still current volunteer Bill Waste.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A first cross-committees + architect meeting was held November 30, 2017 to essentially level-set – share information about work done in the past, review a draft statement of needs and considerations, ask questions and share observations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Kitchen Committee has been at work since May 2017, initially looking at renovations within the existing kitchen & shed footprint, working with users of our kitchen and also with kitchen designers and equipment vendors. A kitchen renovation by itself will be expensive enough to require a capital campaign, which will require AMC approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The initial committees focus starting in November 2017 was to produce a "requirements" stable draft - needs, considerations, constraints that would guide the exploration and assessment of solutions. Based on that, the architect has proposed designs. A stable requirements draft was achieved in early February.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A cross-committees call was held on Feb. 22 with the architect to review an initial draft plan proposed by her, which has since been revised to incorporate various comments and suggestions.  Other sketches have been provided by various committee members for consideration, both in terms of appeal and feasibility, representing design concepts that emphasize several other potential solution characteristics.  At present, the committees are looking at these sketches and the architect designs to formulate more of a consensus on which requirements and design aspects are most important, since some significant tradeoffs may have to be made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The high level plan and schedule is to</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In addition, you are invited to call in to a conference call reviewing project status scheduled for the evening of Thursday April 26 at 7:30 PM EST, to permit CRC community members to telephone in and ask questions and provide input. Further details (phone number and access code) for calling in will be provided via email to the CRC community email address list. We may hold more than one of these community-wide update sessions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Project History</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you’re wondering whatever ultimately happened to the
original Dining Room project the Camp Committee worked in the spring of 2017
and decided to proceed with in May and then was tabled on July 18, or what was
supposed to happen next, that specific effort is superseded by this new overall
Lodge planning effort. It should be observed that even at the time, the Camp
Committee had other things in mind, especially a major kitchen renovation and
the potential incorporation of an indoor, handicap-accessible bathroom. The
Camp Committee’s approach was one of divide and conquer – while realizing these
were all related and needed to be understood to some significant degree
together, they didn’t all have to be worked in lock step. Additionally, the
Camp Committee had the resources to <i>sequentially</i> plan out and set the
dining room project in motion to be ready for 2018 and then involve the CRC
community still with the possibility of making modifications. The opportunity
for 2018 is now behind us, and we are now in the more normal and expected mode
of engaging CRC community members before any seemingly final decisions are
made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For perhaps a decade or so, there has been Camp Committee
discussion of a major renovation to the kitchen area, which would require a
capital campaign to fund.  A committee was created in April 2017 to define a
proposal for the specifics of a renovation, essentially keeping within the
footprint of the existing kitchen/shed space. The members were and still are
Jim Weston and John Dean co-chairs, Garry Crane, Frank Mastro, Cheryl Poirier
and Gail Roberts. They worked over the summer and fall, making great strides in
proposed layout, work flow and equipment. The original plan was to share that
work with the CRC community when a specific proposal was ready, but that took a
pause in order to sync up with the new lodge projects reorganization.</p>
